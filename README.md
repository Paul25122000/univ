IPC - prictice files with structs
    You have some useful commands that I wrote for you in .vscode folder. DO NOT TOUCH IT! :
        Alt+F9 will trigger task "Compiles C file"
        Ctrl+F9 will trigger task "Run C file"
        By "C file" is understood file that is currently focused in workspace (exemple: now README.md is focused)
